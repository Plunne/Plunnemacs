* INTRODUCTION

As an old NeoVim user, I wanted to get the benefits of EMACS in a from scratch configuration.

This is a pretty minimal configuration, you have only the basics for a text editor and an Org experience.

* FEATURES

For the following features, if you are french I made an article of the advantages of EMACS in my blog.

- Emacs client ready
- Evil-Mode
- Which-key
- Projectile
- Fontify
- Icons
- Emojis
- Highlight colors
- Ligatures
- Pretty symbols /(Better look of checkboxes in org-mode and code blocs delimiters)/
- Relative line numbers
- Indent with TAB
- Indent guides
- Doom Themes + Feather Theme /(by default and soon being part of Doom Themes)/
- Solaire Mode with a little change to looks better with Dap Mode
- Centaur tabs /(disabled in anoying modes to looks better)/
